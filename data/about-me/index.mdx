Hello! My name is Franco and I enjoy creating solutions that live on the web. My interest in web development started in 2018 when I decided to try, out of curiosity, to create my first website. I really enjoy the road traveled, designs, architectures, technologies!

Fast forward to today, and I had the privilege of working on **a project for my country's government** and then for [a tourism company](https://gitcordoba.com/) (always talking about systems and development). My main focus these days is creating accessible and inclusive products and digital experiences at [Bitlogic](https://bitlogic.io) for a variety of clients.

Also, I am **teaching front-end web development** for 1 year as a tutor at the [coderhouse academy](https://www.coderhouse.com/).

Here are **some** technologies I've been working with recently:
